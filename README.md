# Kaggle
As the files are IPYNB format, You might not be able to see the code sometimes in git-hub as such because of some backend issue with git-hub.
If so, you can see the codes with their output/visualizations in https://www.kaggle.com/naveen44/code
Or you can copy paste the link of the code at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
Kudos :)
